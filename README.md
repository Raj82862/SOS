* This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the presence, time-in, and time-out of students. It covers areas such as facial detection, alignment, and recognition, along with the development of a native desktop application to cater to various use cases of the system such as registration of new students, addition of photos to the training dataset, viewing attendance reports, etc. 

* This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential.

* This project aims to automate the traditional attendance system where the attendance is marked manually. It also enables an organization to maintain its records like in-time, out time, break time and attendance digitally. Its added features serve as an efficient upgrade and replacement over the traditional attendance system.

## Scope of the project 
Facial recognition is becoming more prominent in our society. It has made major progress in the field of security. 
Face detection may be used for a broad range of purposes, from defense to ads.
Law enforcement by gathering mugshots can evaluate local, national, and federal assets repositories too.
This project servers as a foundation for future projects based on facial detection and recognition. 
This project also covers native desktop application development and database management with a user-friendly UI. Using this system any school and organization can replace their traditional way of maintaining attendance of the employees and can also generate their availability(presence) report throughout the month. It could be used to help in the authentication workflow.
