* This project involves building a solar tracking system, a technology used to maximize the efficiency of solar panels by automatically adjusting their orientation to follow the movement of the sun throughout the day. By continuously aligning the solar panels with the sun's position, solar orienting systems can significantly increase the amount of sunlight captured and convert it into usable energy.

* This project intends to utilize various sensors and control mechanisms to accurately track the sun's position ans serve as an efficient substitute for traditionally used fixed solar panels.

* This project aims to increase energy generation, improve system efficiency, enhance return on investment for solar installations and automate the traditionally traditionally used fixed solar panels giving them seasonal adaptability with the help of flexibility in system design. 

## Scope of the project 

<br /><br />
The scope of the solar orienting system project includes designing, installing, and integrating a solar tracking system that maximizes energy production by adjusting the orientation of solar panels to follow the sun's movement. This involves conducting a site assessment, selecting appropriate equipment, and developing control algorithms for precise tracking. The project also encompasses testing, calibration, and performance monitoring to ensure optimal functionality and efficiency. Documentation, training, and project management are essential for successful implementation. Post-implementation support may be provided to ensure long-term system performance. The specific scope will depend on factors such as the installation site, budget, and project objectives.
