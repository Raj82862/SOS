* This project involves building a solar tracking system, a technology used to maximize the efficiency of solar panels by automatically adjusting their orientation to follow the movement of the sun throughout the day. By continuously aligning the solar panels with the sun's position, solar orienting systems can significantly increase the amount of sunlight captured and convert it into usable energy.

* This project intends to utilize various sensors and control mechanisms to accurately track the sun's position ans serve as an efficient substitute for traditionally used fixed solar panels.

* This project aims to increase energy generation, improve system efficiency, enhance return on investment for solar installations and automate the traditionally traditionally used fixed solar panels giving them seasonal adaptability with the help of flexibility in system design. 

## Scope of the project 
Facial recognition is becoming more prominent in our society. It has made major progress in the field of security. 
Face detection may be used for a broad range of purposes, from defense to ads.
Law enforcement by gathering mugshots can evaluate local, national, and federal assets repositories too.
This project servers as a foundation for future projects based on facial detection and recognition. 
This project also covers native desktop application development and database management with a user-friendly UI. Using this system any school and organization can replace their traditional way of maintaining attendance of the employees and can also generate their availability(presence) report throughout the month. It could be used to help in the authentication workflow.
